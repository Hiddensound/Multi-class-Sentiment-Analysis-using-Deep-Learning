# Multi-class-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Deep-Learning

This is my completed assignment for the course Natural Language Processing (COMP-5413) at Lakehead University.

**NLP_Assignment_2.pdf**:  
  is my assignment question.

**0889445_NLP_Assignment_2_Tejas_Wadiwala.ipynb**:  
  is my completed code for the assignment.

**0889445_NLP_Assignment_2_Tejas_Wadiwala.pdf**:  
  is my IEEE style report that I wrote for my submission.

**0889445_1dconv_reg.h5**:  
  is my saved model. This model can be loaded using model_load() code block in my .ipynb file.

**0889445_Epoch_Archive_Tejas_Wadiwala.pdf**:  
  is the output that I got while training, just copy pasted it for further reference.

**Plots_and_Diagrams**:  
  contains all the high quality images that I used in my report.
  * Preprocessing_steps.png and Assign_2_Model.png were created using Lucidchart.
  * Loss_Epoch.png, Accuracy_Epoch.png, and assgn2.png were created using matplotlib and are saved
    using savefig() command.
